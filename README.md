# Building a Honeypot + SOC in Azure

In this project, I set up a basic Security Operations Center (SOC) in the cloud using a free Azure subscription. 
The goal was to create a honeypot, expose it to the internet, and monitor real-world attacks while learning about log analysis and security monitoring.

## Setting Up a Honeypot

The core idea was to set up a honeypot, a deliberately exposed virtual machine (VM) to attract attackers and log their activity. The process involved:

- Creating a virtual machine in Azure

- Opening it up to the public internet

- Observing and analyzing incoming attacks
> [!NOTE]
> All failed attack attempts were logged and forwarded to a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system. This allowed for real-time monitoring, querying, and visualizing attacker locations on a map.

## Infrastructure Setup

To build the environment, I deployed:

- Resource Group: A container to organize Azure resources

- Virtual Network: A private network within Azure

- Virtual Machine (VM): A cloud-based Windows instance

- Network Security Group (NSG): A firewall managing inbound and outbound traffic

## Configuring Network Security

To attract attackers, I configured the NSG to expose the VM:

1. Removed the default Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) rule

2. Added a new inbound rule with the following settings:

    - Destination: Any
    
    - Service: Custom
    
    - Port: Any (*, meaning all ports open)
    
    - Protocol: Any
    
    - Priority: 100 (lower priority means the rule is evaluated sooner)
    
    - Name: danger (to indicate the rule is intentionally dangerous)

## Accessing the Virtual Machine and turning off Firewall

I connected to the VM using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and verified its exposure by:

- Pinging the public IP from a local machine

- Disabling Windows Firewall to increase visibility

## Exploring Local Logs

To capture failed login attempts, I intentionally tried logging in with a fake account (employee). These failed attempts were recorded in Windows Event Viewer

> [!NOTE]
> Event ID 4625 – Failed logon attempts

## Setting Up Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM)

1. Created a Log Analytics Workspace to store logs centrally

2. Installed Microsoft Sentinel for real-time security analysis

3. Connected the VM to Sentinel using the Azure Monitoring Agent

4. Configured a Data Collection Rule (DCR) to forward logs from the VM

## Monitoring Agent Installation and Log Forwarding

Once the Azure Monitoring Agent was installed, logs started flowing into Sentinel. To check log activity, I ran queries in the Log Analytics Workspace, filtering for Event ID 4625.

## Mapping IP Addresses to Physical Locations

To geolocate attackers, I uploaded an IP-to-location spreadsheet into Sentinel. This contained:

- IP ranges
  
- Latitude & longitude
  
- City & country information

> [!NOTE]
> Using this data, Sentinel automatically mapped attackers based on their IP addresses.
> Example: IP 185.56.73.169 mapped to Poland, identified as an ISP-owned block.

A watch list was created to store geographic information.

## Using the Watch List to Look Up IP Addresses

After uploading the watch list, I ran a KQL query to join security logs with the location data, enriching logs with attacker city, country, and coordinates.

## Creating an Attack Map in Sentinel 

To visualize attacks, I built a real-time attack map in Sentinel:

- Created a new workbook

- Used KQL queries to plot failed logins on a map

- Applied a heatmap to highlight attack intensity

The map updated dynamically, displaying real-time hacker activity worldwide.

## Attack Map

The final attack map displayed:

- Locations of attackers

- Frequency of login attempts

- Geographical distribution over time

As attack sources changed, the attack map evolved, displaying new data.

## Final Recap

Key Takeaways from This Project

- Set up a honeypot in Azure

- Exposed the VM to attackers & logged failed login attempts

- Forwarded logs to Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM)

- Used KQL queries to analyze security events

- Built a real-time attack map to visualize hacker locations


**This project demonstrated how real-world cyber threats can be monitored using cloud-based SIEM solutions like Sentinel.**
